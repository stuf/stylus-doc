Parse JSDoc-like comments from your [Stylus][] files into proper documentation.

# stylus-doc

Currently just a practice in parsing data from files in Haskell and constructing
(maybe) something meaningful from it.

This project starts off from na√Øvely parsing file content through a series of `map`
calls and similar, and hoping to end up with something that uses monads more extensively.
